# Triggerbee Tracking Template for Google Tag Manager

The **Triggerbee Tracking Template** enables seamless integration of **Triggerbee** with **Google Tag Manager (GTM)**, allowing you to track visitor interactions, personalize experiences, and measure conversions across your website. 

This template simplifies the process of injecting Triggerbeeâ€™s tracking scripts into your website, helping you monitor key actions, track conversions, and push data to the Google Tag Manager **DataLayer** for further analysis and reporting.

## Features

- **Track Visitor Interactions**: Capture detailed visitor behavior and track goals or conversions.
- **Personalize Experiences**: Dynamically adjust content or trigger actions based on visitor behavior.
- **Easy DataLayer Integration**: Push Triggerbee event data (e.g., `triggerbeeActive`) directly to the GTM **DataLayer**.

## Requirements

- **Google Tag Manager** account
- **Triggerbee** account
- Website with **Google Tag Manager** installed

## Installation

### Step 1:  Install and configure the Template

1. In GTM, create a new **Tag** and find the **Triggerbee Tracking Template** by searching the community templates.
2. Fill in your **Triggerbee Site ID** (found in your Triggerbee account).
3. Optionally, enable **DataLayer push** for tracking successful Triggerbee events.

### Step 3: Add Triggers

1. Assign a **Trigger** to the **Triggerbee Tracking Tag** to determine when the tag should fire (e.g., on **Page View** or **Custom Events**).
2. Click **Save**.

### Step 4: Publish

1. After setting up your tags and triggers, **Preview** the container to test your setup.
2. Once tested, click **Submit** to publish your changes.

## Usage

Once installed and configured, the Triggerbee tracking script will be injected onto your site, allowing you to monitor visitor interactions and conversions via **Google Tag Manager**.

If **DataLayer push** is enabled, the event **`triggerbeeActive`** will be pushed to the GTM **DataLayer**, where you can set up additional tags or triggers based on the event.
